Introduction
============

What is PyGeoHash?
-----------------

PyGeoHash is a Python module that provides functions for encoding and decoding geohashes to and from latitude and 
longitude coordinates, along with utilities for performing calculations and approximations with them.

It is based on Leonard Norrg√•rd's `geohash <https://github.com/vinsci/geohash>`_ module, but adds more 
functionality while supporting Python 3.

Why Use PyGeoHash?
-----------------

PyGeoHash offers several advantages:

- **Simplicity**: The API is designed to be intuitive and easy to use
- **No Dependencies**: Works with just the Python standard library
- **Lightweight**: Adds minimal overhead to your projects
- **Python 3 Support**: Fully compatible with modern Python
- **Robust Implementation**: Reliable geohash operations for production use

Use Cases
---------

PyGeoHash is ideal for a variety of applications:

- **Location-based Services**: Efficiently store and retrieve location data
- **Spatial Indexing**: Create spatial indexes for geographic data
- **Proximity Searches**: Find nearby points of interest
- **Geographic Data Clustering**: Group locations by their geohash prefixes
- **Location Encoding with Privacy**: Control precision to manage privacy concerns

Project History
--------------

PyGeoHash was created to modernize and extend the functionality of the original geohash module while ensuring compatibility with Python 3. The project aims to maintain a clean, dependency-free implementation that can be easily integrated into any Python project.
